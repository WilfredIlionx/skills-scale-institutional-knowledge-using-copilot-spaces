# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome! This README provides an orientation to OctoAcme's project management processes and is your starting point for understanding how we deliver projects efficiently and collaboratively.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme projects follow a pragmatic, iterative approach based on industry best practices:

- **Initiation:** Validate ideas, align stakeholders, and define success.
- **Planning:** Break down work, identify dependencies, estimate, and commit.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Daily standups, structured workflow, quality gates, and regular demos.
- **Risk Management & Communication:** Maintain a risk register, communicate proactively, escalate blockers.
- **Release & Deployment:** Standard procedures for release types, readiness checks, and incident playbooks.
- **Retrospectives & Improvement:** Frequent retros to drive learning and actionable improvements.

Roles, responsibilities, and templates are clearly defined throughout.
